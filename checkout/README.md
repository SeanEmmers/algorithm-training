## Checkout
The purpose of this challenge is to implement a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items - to be run in a REPL like IRB. Don't worry about I/O.

## Requirements
In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we'll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually.
