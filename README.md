### A collection of coding Kata's

I am using this repo as a collection of the kata's I have completed or are in progress. <br/>
I try to use TDD to solve all of the kata's, the majority of them also have a README attached detailing the problem <br/>
I have found starting each day with 30 minutes of algorithm training helps to get my brain engaged <br/>

The majority of the problems are 5/6kyu on Codewars
