the function should take three inputs

- amount of rows
- amount of seats in row
- first row number

if the input for the function was 2,4,1 the expected output would be 
```
['1A', '1B', '1C', '1D', '2A', '2B', '2C', '2D']
```
- The amount of rows is two
- The number of seats in each row (A-D) is 4
- The first row number is 1 (1A)
