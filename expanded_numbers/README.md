You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:

expanded_numbers(12); # Should return '10 + 2'
expanded_numbers(42); # Should return '40 + 2'
expanded_numbers(70304); # Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'

it returns the number + how many numbers after it unless zero then it skips that number
